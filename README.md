# Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy
## Automated Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Using VGG16, MobileNet, and Multi-Head Attention

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye).

## There are two types of diabetes-related retinopathy:
## •	Nonproliferative Diabetes Related Retinopathy (NPDR): In this early disease stage, people have blood vessels which leak in the retina. This manifests with either fluid, hemorrhage, or lipid seen in the retina. Eventually these blood vessels close causing ischemia or poor blood flow.
## •	Proliferative Diabetes Related Retinopathy (PDR): When the disease progresses, abnormal blood vessels grow in response to the ischemia. These abnormal vessels can leak blood into the gel-like substance (vitreous) that fills your eye and cause tractional changes to the surface of the retina detaching it and resulting in severe vision loss in late stages.

This is my latest project on the automated diagonosis of Diabetic Retinopathy, a condition that affects millions of people with diabetes and can lead to vision loss if not detected early.
In this project, I leveraged VGG16 and MobileNet models, combined with Multi Head Attention, to create a highly efficient system for detecting the presence or absence of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images. This Deep Learning based approach minimizes human error, Accelerates the diagnostic process and assists healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely decisions.

## Key Results: -
## 1)	VGG16 Model with Attention: 
## a.	Interface Time = 1011.4659 seconds
## b.	Accuracy = 94%
## c.	Precision = 94%
## d.	Recall = 94%
## e.	F1-Score = 94%

## 2)	MobileNet Model: 
## a.	Interface Time = 365.3900 seconds
## b.	Accuracy = 96%
## c.	Precision = 96%
## d.	Recall = 96%
## e.	F1-Score = 96%

### Both models deliver high performance with a Precision, Recall and F1-Score of over 94%, ensuring robust detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. MobileNet achieved better Accuracy and faster Interface time, making it a more efficient solution for real-time diagnostics.

## Conclusion: -
This project highlights the potential of using Deep Learning for Medical image analysis, improving both the speed and Accuracy of Diabetic Retinopathy diagnosis
